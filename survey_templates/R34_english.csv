Taking all of the notes from the basic format csv file and putting it here for reference:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"You can put any character in these cells, including alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, and 0-9), special characters like commas, parentheses (), square and curly brackets [] {}, apostraphes and quotation marks ''"""", dollar signs $, percent signs %, etc…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Any line that does not start with a valid identifier or question number/type is considered a comment, so feel free to comment throughout the file to make it easier to read.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Valid identifiers are the following:,"In cell 1A: ""Name:"" tells the program that this is a valid protocol file, and that the following cell contains the protocol name. This should only appear once in your file",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"In column A, before all of the questions, you can put either of the following identifiers: ""alter data:"" or ""relationship group:"". Be careful, if you misspell these identifiers, leave off the colon, or do not put them in column A, the program will not recognize it and will simply treat that line as a comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"Explanation of ""alter data:""","Alter data is set of fields that the user fills in when creating new alters. These are either text or number fields, and are typically things like ""First Name"", ""Last Name"", ""Age"", etc…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"Explanation of ""relationship group:""","Relationship groups are options that the user specifies when creating new alters as well. The user may select any different combination of relationships for an alter. These groups are typically things like ""Family"", ""Mentors"", etc, and the relationships within the groups are typically things like ""Mother/Father"", ""Sister/Brother"", ""Teacher"", ""Coach"", etc...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Specifying questions:,"When writing questions, you must start the line with a question number in column A, and the question type in column B. If you do not spell the question type correct, it will not be recognized and the line will be treated as a comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Question Types:,generate,"Name Generator questions allow the user to generate other alters that he/she will manipulate later. This may be used for questions like ""Create alters for any people with whom you are close."" These alters will then be used later in the categorize, soc-arrange, soc-select, and soc-connect questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,categorize,"Categorize questions allow the user to drag each of the alters into bins with different values. This may be used for questions such as: ""How often do you see each person?"" ""Daily"", ""Weekly"", ""Rarely"", or ""Never"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,soc-arrange,"Sociogram-Arrange questions allow the user to drag alters onto a sociogram in a manner logical to them. This may be used to see how far the user positions each person from the center (where the user is) and how far the user arranges alters from each other. One may gain insight not only into how close the user is with each alter, but also how close each alter is to other alters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,soc-select,"Sociogram-Select questions allow the user to select any of the alters on the sociogram and highlight them. This may be used for questions like ""Tap on each person who has given you money in the past month.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
